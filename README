CVE Automation Tool (CAT)
Python script that allows researchers to aggregate CVEs (with cooresponding CWEs) from NVD.NIST.GOV in order to 
see trends and filter issues by keywords for differing operating systems, vulnerability types, risk level, 
and other factors that are relevant to cyber security, whether red or blue team.
